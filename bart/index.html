      <p class="bart-bio">Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (born February 23 1979), also known as "El Barto", "The boy" (Homer Simpson), and "Bartman", is the tritagonist of The Simpsons. He is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood and "potentially dangerous" eldest child of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart's also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11" and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a whole 100-issue comic series known as the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark.
        Even at a young age Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series, he has discovered a new comet which was named after himself, and he also has perfomed in a successful band with Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz and Ralph Wiggum.
